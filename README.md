## Installation/Use
- In order to run, you just need Google Chrome installed
- The app is in this folder, you can drag and drop it into you applications folder if you'd like.
- When first opening it, it will say it's from an unidentified developer, don't worry I built the whole thing and it will not cause a single issue on your computer
- To get passed this issue, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy and hit open anyways
- Once it opens and also when you hit run, it may ask for more permissions depending on where you put the application file, but once again I'm not trying to mess up your computer, so just hit yes
- Fill out your data and hit run, don't forget the signature at the end
